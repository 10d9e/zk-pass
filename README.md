Certainly! Below are additional verbose instructions explaining how to start the server from the command line and an overview of the options you can use:

### Starting the Server from the Command Line

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:** First, make sure you have a terminal or command prompt window open.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the directory where the server code is located.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project_directory
   ```

3. **Build the Project (if needed):** If you haven't already built your Rust project, you can build it using the `cargo build` command. This step is necessary if you've made changes to the code since the last build.

   Example:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Run the Server:** To start the server, use the `cargo run` command followed by the necessary options.

   Example:
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --host <host_address> --port <port_number> --modp <modp_type> --type <protocol_type> --curve <elliptic_curve_type>
   ```

   Replace `<host_address>`, `<port_number>`, `<modp_type>`, `<protocol_type>`, and `<elliptic_curve_type>` with the appropriate values based on your needs.

### Available Command Line Options

- **`--host` or `-h`:** Sets the host address for the server. If not specified, defaults to "[::1]" (localhost).

- **`--port` or `-p`:** Sets the port number for the server. If not specified, defaults to 50051.

- **`--modp` or `-m`:** Sets the type of the RFC log group to use. This option is required if the protocol type (`--type`) is set to "discrete_log".

- **`--type` or `-t`:** Sets the underlying type of the Chaum-Pedersen protocol to use. Possible values are "discrete_log" and "elliptic_curve".

- **`--curve` or `-c`:** Sets the elliptic curve type. This option is required if the protocol type (`--type`) is set to "elliptic_curve".

### Example Usage

Here's an example command to start the server on localhost, port 50051, using the discrete log protocol:

```bash
cargo run -- --host [::1] --port 50051 --type discrete_log
```

Remember to replace the values in the command with those suitable for your setup. The server will start and listen for connections based on the provided options.
